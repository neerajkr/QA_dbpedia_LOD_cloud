This repository contains the work for warmup task for the project: "Question Answering from DBpedia to the whole LOD cloud" whose idea is on this link- http://wiki.dbpedia.org/ideas/idea/283/question-answering-from-dbpedia-to-the-whole-lod-cloud/

I have added two files- one is .txt and other one is .pdf file. Both files contain the list of open source speech recognition softwares. The same list is available on the drive link : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_qIhPp8K1h5hERRq4in1ye2K_av8KsJcXFsQjJnGShQ/edit?usp=sharing

Feel free to make changes and add new open source speech recognition software
